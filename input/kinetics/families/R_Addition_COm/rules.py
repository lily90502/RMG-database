The geometries of all reactants, products, and the transition state were optimized using the CBS-QB3 method.
The zero-point energy is that computed by the CBS-QB3 calculations.  The frequencies were computed with B3LYP/CBSB7.
In computing k(T), an asymmetric tunneling correction was employed, the calculated frequencies were scaled by 0.99, and the 
temperatures used were from 600 K to 2000 K (in 200 K increments).
